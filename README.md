# Retro_Snake
Redesigned the classic snake game with new added game modes using Python and Pygames. Implemented a functioning menu, stored high scores, multiple snakes, dynamic maps, accurate collisions, elaborate GUI and many backend functions to handle case by case scenarios. 

The Files folder contains the neccessary files for the sound and text used in the game. These can be changed easily if desired. This folder also contains the score.txt file which is used to store high scores. This file can be manually reset if need be for any reason.
